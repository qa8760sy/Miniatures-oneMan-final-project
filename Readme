This is a program that will allow someone to create an army list for warhammer 40k, warhammer 40k Kill team, Starwars Miniatures and
untested but im sure warhammer age of sigmar, night vault, bloodbowl as well assuming they follow the usual GamesWorkshop template.

to name your team and file that it will be saved as simply enter what you'd like in the team name field once the application opens
FIle will save in current running directory

There is a known issue, the arrayList needs to be wiped after each save, I just haven't implimented it yet. Its an easy fix but i can't 
do it this minute

There will not be any future updates, you dont have my permission to modify the code.
There is no support for the application
